# Simple Note APP

## Overview

This application is a result of Javascript training and my own work. The basic structure was prepared with the trainer's assistance. Further enhancement are my own design.

This is a simple note app which you can use to store your notes. Works in the console. It is fast and operational on every PC platform.
